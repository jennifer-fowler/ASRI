## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

# using this symbol renders a line inactive, R will skip over it when reading your code commands. 
# this is called "commenting" and is used to make notes in your code
# you can use these notes to remind yourself why or how you did something
# or to show someone else when you share your code

# here is an active code line: 

R.Version()

#this will check which version of R is installed on your computer and return the information in the console

# R will read your commands in this structure: function(variable)

```


We are going to explore some data that comes built into R and perform a basic linear regression and a simple plot. 

One dataset that comes with R is called quakes and is a record of earthquakes off the coast of Fiji. 

First we have to load the data so R knows what we want to work with. 


```{r}
# load the data using the data() function
data(quakes)
```

Now let's take a look at the data. This is an important first step in working with data, called exploratory data analysis or EDA.

R has some great functions to help us look at data.

```{r}
# examine the structure of the dataset using the str() function
str(quakes)
```
Now we see the names of the columns/variables/features, and what those columns contain (the data points or observations), as well as how large the dataset is and the type of variables involved (numeric and integers).

```{r}
#examine the first six rows of the dataset using the head() function
head(quakes)
```

This gave us a nice table view of the first six rows and the columns of the dataset. Now let's see what it looks like in some basic plots. I wonder, which variables might be related or correlated? 

```{r}
# we will build some plots to see if it looks like any variables are correlated
# let's start with magnitude and depth of the earthquakes
# we can use the plot() function with the formula plot(x,y) in format data$variable, data$variable

plot(quakes$mag, quakes$depth)
```

That doesn't look like depth and magnitude is correlated. Let's try another one.

```{r}
# trying the plot function again, with depth and number of stations reporting
plot(quakes$depth, quakes$stations)
```
It doesn't look like depth and number of stations reporting is correlated either. Let's try one more. 

```{r}
# trying the plot function again, with magnitude and number of stations reporting
plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations)
```
Now that looks interesting. Makes a bit of sense, that the stronger the earthquake, the more stations would detect it and report it. Let's make the plot look a bit better. 

```{r}
# we are going to add some labels and a title to the plot
plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations,
     #first we will do the x-label
     xlab= "Magnitude",
     #now the y-label
     ylab= "Number of Stations Reported",
     # now the main plot title
     main= "Magnitude of Fiji Earthquakes and Number of Stations Reported",
     # let's change the plot points color, R can recognize a number of color names
     # try a color you like inside double quotation marks
     # look at the R color cheat sheet in your student binder
     col = "blue",
     # and change the plotting character symbol
     #this can be a range from 0-18 with different symbols
     #try and find one you like
     pch = 3
     )
```

Now we have a pretty plot, let's see mathematically or statistically evaluate what that correlation is. We can use a built-in function for linear regression model lm(). In this function we will give it the argument lm(response~predictor) where the response is the y variable and predictor is the x variable. In our example, what is the response? What is the predictor?

```{r}
# now build the linear model, let's assign it a special name
quakes.model=lm(quakes$stations~quakes$mag)
```

Great, it showed up in our environment pane --->
Let's see the details using the summary() function.

```{r}
#check the summary of the linear regression model
summary(quakes.model)
```

Ok, let's see what the summary tells us. Quick reminder: a linear regression model or correlation has the formula y = mx+b where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. 

The slope is 46.28. What is the intercept?  

So our formula is... 

What is the p-value, and is it statistically significant?

Let's plot the line of our linear regression formula on our plot.

```{r}
plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations,
     xlab= "Magnitude",
     ylab= "Number of Stations Reported",
     main= "Magnitude of Fiji Earthquakes and Number of Stations Reported",
     col = "blue",
     pch = 3
)
# now we will add a feature to the plot
#and the function for an a-b line which adds a straight line
abline(-180.42, 46.28)
```

I want the line to be more visible. Let's change the color and width of it. 

```{r}
plot(quakes$mag, quakes$stations,
     xlab= "Magnitude",
     ylab= "Number of Stations Reported",
     main= "Magnitude of Fiji Earthquakes and Number of Stations Reported",
     col = "blue",
     pch = 3
)
  #customize the line color using col = , and line width by lwd =
abline(-180.42, 46.28, col = "red", lwd = 3)
```


If we have time...

Let's explore what other datasets are built into R that we can play with.

```{r}
# this prints a list of all the built-in datasets
data()
```
